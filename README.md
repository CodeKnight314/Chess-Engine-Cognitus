## Overview
This is a side project of mine to learn more about Deep-Q-Learning. The model, Renatus, is built on a convolutional network with residual blocks and convolutional layers, clocking in at 27 million trainable parameters. Renatus is trained with combined paradigms, being first pretrained on supervised learning with games from LiChess then undergoing self-play paradigm to discover new tactics. Renatus is also combined with herustics to better guide decision making. Follow as I work and develop on this project over time!
