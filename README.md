# Chess-Engine-Cognitus

## Overview
This is a python-based chess engine for deploying algorithimic based min-maxing game-playing agents with Alpha-Beta pruning. Due to python's inherent slow runtime, the engine, Cognitus, is restricted to limited depth and time. As of now, it performs suboptimally at Depth 3-5 for any given board with 20 seconds time limit. With future optimization inclduing Cython or Numba, Cognitus aims to run as competitve speeds and search at impressive depths. The project's previous focus on ML and Deep-Q-Learning based chess engine has been moved to separate repository due to change of this repository's focus and computation budget issues.
